There are atleast 3 different installation tutorials on CheckMATE's page scattered here and there. Different tutorials = different installation methods. 


Combinations tried:


root6 (source compiled) + pythia8306+ MadGraph3.1.1 + hepmc2.06.11 + Delphes3.5.0 + CheckMATE-Current

root6 (precompiled binary) + pythia8306+ MadGraph3.1.1 + hepmc2.06.11 + Delphes3.5.0 + CheckMATE-Current

These don't work as ROOT6 has internally compiled python.
Hence, root-config --has-python outputs "no". 
Error encountered: ROOT installed but hasn't been configured with python.



Installed Virtual Machine (was reluctant to do so) - less freedom/control over the system.
CheckMATE works, nll works... ROOT not installed (didn't use it anyway). Enabled a shared folder between the local host and Virtual Machine.
In a nutshell, Virtual Machine works!



root5 (source compiled) + pythia8306+ MadGraph3.1.1 + hepmc2.06.11 + Delphes3.5.0 + CheckMATE-Current

Personally, this didn't work because there were some errors in  source compilation. 
I don't know why... first installation worked but CheckMATE couldn't be configured.
In second installation: neither root nor CheckMATE could be configured.




root5 (precompiled binary) + pythia8219 + MadGraph2.2.3 + hepmc2.06.09 + Delphes3.2.0 + CheckMATE-2.0.24 

Tried to clone the virtualbox's installed versions.
Seemed to work surpisingly until :

./CheckMATE -n example -mgcommand="import model MSSM_SLHA2; generate p p > go go;" -maxev 500 -slha=example_run_cards/auxiliary/testspectrum.slha -wp8

was executed.

Error encountered: 	ERROR IN FRITZ - MODULE: Unknown
                	MESSAGE: can't find class 'OldCalorimeter'
					-----> IMMEDIATE ABORT!

Don't know whether - an error/warning in Delphes' installation or CheckMATE's - since CheckMATE <- Delphes.
